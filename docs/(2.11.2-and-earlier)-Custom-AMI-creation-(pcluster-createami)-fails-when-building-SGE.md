### The issue
Custom AMI creation with command `pcluster createami` or cluster creation using custom AMI with no pre-baked ParallelCluster software stack are failing with the following error:

```

```

Root cause is because `arc.liv.ac.uk` is down and itâ€™s not possible to download SGE sources from `https://arc.liv.ac.uk/downloads/SGE/releases/8.1.9/sge-8.1.9.tar.gz`


### Affected ParallelCluster versions and OS
2.11.2 and older are affected, OS affected according to the following table:

| version\os | AL1 | AL2 | CentOS6 | CentOS7 | CentOS8 | Ubuntu16 | Ubuntu18 | Ubuntu20 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2.11.2 | not supported | AFFECTED | not supported | AFFECTED | AFFECTED | not supported | OK | OK |
| 2.10.4 | AFFECTED | OK | not supported | AFFECTED | AFFECTED |AFFECTED | OK | not supported |
| 2.9.1 | AFFECTED | OK | AFFECTED | AFFECTED | not supported | AFFECTED | OK | not supported |

Bug affects the following functionalities
* create custom AMI using command `pcluster createami`
* SGE cluster creation with runtime bake (HeadNode cannot be created)
* existing SGE clusters with version older than 2.3.0 (included) using runtime bake

Existing clusters since 2.4.0 (included) aren't affected because SGE isn't installed on compute nodes, but it's shared from HeadNode

### The workarounds
**For createami**
* For custom AMI creation, instead of using the `pcluster createami` command, follow the guide
"Building a Custom AWS ParallelCluster AMI -> Modify an AWS ParallelCluster AMI" from [this doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/tutorials_02_ami_customization.html)

* As alternative, If you aren't using SGE and still want to use the `pcluster createami` command, do the following
  *  Create a script named `patch_skip_sge_installation.sh` with the following contents. Replace ParallelCluster version with the version you want to patch:
  ```
  #!/bin/bash
  
  VERSION="<parallelcluster-version>"
  git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-parallelcluster-cookbook.git
  cd ./aws-parallelcluster-cookbook
  git fetch origin
  git checkout v$VERSION
  
  sed -i "s/^include_recipe 'aws-parallelcluster::sge_install'/#&/g" recipes/default.rb
  # if you are using "BSD sed" replace the above sed line with the following one
  # sed -i "" "s/^include_recipe 'aws-parallelcluster::sge_install'/#&/g" recipes/default.rb
  
  cd ..
  tar zcvf "$(pwd)/aws-parallelcluster-cookbook-${VERSION}.tgz" ./aws-parallelcluster-cookbook
  ```
  *  Execute the script
  ```
  bash patch_skip_sge_installation.sh
  ```
  *  A tar file with name `aws-parallelcluster-cookbook-$VERSION.tgz` will be generated. Upload the generated cookbook to your S3 bucket.
  *  Use the custom cookbook as parameter for the `createami` command, e.g.
  ```
  pcluster createami -ai $BASE_AMI_ID -os $BASE_AMI_OS -cc <custom-cookbook-s3-url>
  ```
  
* If, instead, you are required to use SGE with one of the affected OS, do the following:
  * Spin up an instance from an official ParalleCLuster AMI, OS doesn't matter, version not greater than 2.11.2, e.g. `ami-05c34afa8785834ae` in `us-east-1`
  * From the instance, retrieve the file `/opt/parallelcluster/sources/sge-8.1.9.tar.gz` and upload it into a S3 bucket
  * Create a script named `patch_sge_url.sh` with the following contents. Replace ParallelCluster version with the version you want to patch and SGE source with the S3 URL where the SGE sources were uploaded:
  ```
  #!/bin/bash
  
  VERSION="<parallelcluster-version>"
  git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-parallelcluster-cookbook.git
  cd ./aws-parallelcluster-cookbook
  git fetch origin
  git checkout v$VERSION
  
  sed -i "s/default\['cfncluster'\]\['sge'\]\['url'\]/#&/g" attributes/default.rb
  # if you are using "BSD sed" replace the above sed line with the following one
  # sed -i "" "s/default\['cfncluster'\]\['sge'\]\['url'\]/#&/g" attributes/default.rb
  
  echo "default['cfncluster']['sge']['url'] = '<sge-sources-s3-url>'" >> attributes/default.rb

  cd ..
  tar zcvf "$(pwd)/aws-parallelcluster-cookbook-${VERSION}.tgz" ./aws-parallelcluster-cookbook
  ```
  *  Execute the script
  ```
  bash patch_sge_url.sh
  ```
  *  A tar file with name `aws-parallelcluster-cookbook-$VERSION.tgz` will be generated. Upload the generated cookbook to your S3 bucket.
  *  Use the custom cookbook as parameter for the `createami` command, e.g.
  ```
  pcluster createami -ai $BASE_AMI_ID -os $BASE_AMI_OS -cc <custom-cookbook-s3-url>
  ```

**For cluster creation**
For SGE cluster creation, avoid using an AMI not backed with ParallelCluster software stack and build an AMI in advance following one of the above workaround.
