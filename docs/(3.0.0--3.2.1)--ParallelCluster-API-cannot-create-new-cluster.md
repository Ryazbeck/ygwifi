### Bug description

In versions `3.0.0` to `3.2.1` of ParallelCluster, the API is by default deployed with a role that includes the IAM permissions required to perform the operations of the API. Due to a recent change in the  CloudWatch service, the permissions required to create a cluster were expanded (to include `logs:TagResource` and `logs:UntagResource`), As a result, any existing API deployed using the default role will lack sufficient permissions to create new clusters. When creating a cluster, the CloudFormation stack will show resources with the following error: 

```
User with accountId: XXX is not authorized to perform CreateLogGroup with Tags (Service: CloudWatchLogs, Status Code: 400, Request ID: 4c848ae1-5ff5-43dc-b67b-fd1a0f8cc33e)
```

If you are deploying the API with a custom role, or using the ParallelCluster CLI with specific IAM permissions, the `logs:TagResource` and `logs:UntagResource` actions need to be added to your policy.

### Mitigation
To work around the issue on an existing deployed API, you will need to expand the permissions of the role used by the deployed Lambda. 

1. Navigate to the [IAM Management Console > Policies](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/policies)
2. Search for `ParallelClusterClusterPolicy`
3. Search for the actions with `Sid` matching `CloudWatchLogs`
4. Edit the matching policy to add the following two permissions to the 
    `logs:TagResource`
    `logs:UntagResource`
5. Search for `ParallelClusterBuildImageManagedPolicy `
6. Search for the actions with `Sid` matching `CloudWatch`
7. Repeat Step 4 above for the policy.


This will expand the policies used by the Lambda to include the new required policy to perform ParallelCluster operations.
