## The issue

Starting from 2021-03-03 the `build-image` command may fail during stack deletion after image created successfully. 
From the result of `pcluster describe-image --image-id <your-image-id>` , `imageBuildStatus` is in `BUILD_COMPLETE`  state and image `state` is `AVAILABLE`, but the CloudFormation stack deletion failed with the following error messages: 
```
Resource handler returned message: 
"User: arn:aws:sts::1234567:assumed-role/ParallelClusterImageCleanup-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx/ParallelClusterImage-xxxxx is not authorized to perform: 
imagebuilder:GetImage on resource: arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-east-1:1234567:image/parallelclusterimage-build-image/3.1.2/1 
(Service: Imagebuilder, Status Code: 403, Request ID: xxx)" 
(RequestToken: xxxxx, HandlerErrorCode: GeneralServiceException)

Resource handler returned message: 
"User: arn:aws:sts::1234567:xxxx is not authorized to perform: 
imagebuilder:CancelImageCreation on resource: arn:aws:imagebuilder:sa-east-1:1234567:image/parallelclusterimage-integ-tests-build-image-xxx/3.1.2/1 
(Service: Imagebuilder, Status Code: 403, Request ID: xxx)" 
(RequestToken: xxxx, HandlerErrorCode: GeneralServiceException)
 ```

You can verify whether you are impacted by the issue by executing the following command:
```
pcluster get-image-stack-events --image-id <your-image-id> --region <image-build-region> --query "events[0]"
```
Then you can check from the output if the `resourceStatus` and `resourceStatusReason` match the following:
```
"resourceStatusReason": "The following resource(s) failed to delete: [ParallelClusterImage]. "
"resourceStatus": "DELETE_FAILED",
```
If you are not impacted by the issue, the following output is expected:
```
{
  "message": "CloudFormation Stack for Image build-image does not exist."
}
```

The root cause of the problem is that the new version of EC2 Image Builder service, which is used by ParallelCluster `build-image` command, requires two new additional IAM policies `imagebuilder:GetImage` and `imagebuilder:CancelImageCreation`.

## Affected versions 

This issue affects ParallelCluster versions from 3.0.0 to 3.1.2 when using `build-image` functionality.

## Mitigation

There are two options to mitigate to problem. Option 1 can be used to manually delete a stack in `DELETE_FAILED`. Option 2 can be used if you want to use `build-image` command in the future but want to avoid delete the stack by hand after the image build successfully.

### Option1:  Manually delete the stack after image become available

Use `pcluster describe-image` command to make sure the image is already created:
```
>pcluster describe-image --image-id <your-image-id> --region <image-region>
{
  "imageConfiguration": {
    "url":...
  },
  "imageId": "your-image-id",
  "creationTime": "2022-03-06T21:20:52.000Z",
  "imageBuildStatus": "BUILD_COMPLETE",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "ec2AmiInfo": {
    "amiName": "...",
    "amiId": "ami-xxx",
    "description": "...",
    "state": "AVAILABLE",
    "tags": [...],
    "architecture": "x86_64"
  },
  "version": "3.1.2"
}
```
After seeing `imageBuildStatus` is in `BUILD_COMPLETE` and image `state` is `AVAILABLE`, you can manually delete the stack by using command:
```
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name <your-image-id>
```
Or you can go to AWS CloudFormation console, find the stack named with `image_id` and delete it.


### Option2: Add  AdditionalIamPolicies and CleanupLambdaRole to build-image config

This option can be used if you want to use `build-image` command in the future and you want to avoid to delete the stack by hand after the image build successfully.

You can use the `CleanupLambdaRole` from [ParallelCluster documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/iam-roles-in-parallelcluster-v3.html#iam-roles-in-parallelcluster-v3-custom-image-configuration-cleanuplambdarole). The `CleanupLambdaRole` should contains policies `imagebuilder:GetImage` and `imagebuilder:CancelImageCreation`.

After creating the custom `CleanupLambdaRole`, add the role to `build-image` configuration:
```
Build:
  Iam:
    CleanupLambdaRole: <custom cleanup_lambda_role>      
```
