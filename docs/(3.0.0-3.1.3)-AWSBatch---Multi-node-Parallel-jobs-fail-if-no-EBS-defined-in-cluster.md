## The issue

When the scheduler of the cluster is awsbatch and a [Multi-node Parallel (MNP)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/multi-node-parallel-jobs.html) job is submitted, in case there is no EBS shared volume defined in the cluster, the job will fail. The failure is caused by the requirement of a shared volume to exchange information regarding the nodes involved in the multi node execution.

The MNP job fails with error:
```
Error executing script: Shared directory /NONE does not exist
```
## Affected versions (OSes, schedulers)

* All versions of ParallelCluster >= 3.0.0 are affected when run a multi node parallel job and there is not a EBS defined in the cluster

## Mitigation

Create a cluster with at least one shared EBS volume
