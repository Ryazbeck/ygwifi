### The issue
Note: As a 2022-01-20, the issue has been fix. Users do not need any further actions.

On 2021-03-04 version 0.6.0 of the [pystache python package](https://github.com/sarnold/pystache/releases/tag/0.6.0) was released. This package is a dependency of the [aws-cfn-bootstrap package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/releasehistory-aws-cfn-bootstrap.html#releasehistory-aws-cfn-bootstrap-v1), which contains the [AWS CloudFormation helper scripts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-helper-scripts-reference.html).
The new version of the `pystache` package dropped support for python 2.x, causing the installation of the aws-cfn-bootstrap package to fail when occurring as part of the `pcluster build-image` (ParallelCluster 3.x) or `pcluster createami` (ParallelCluster 2.x) commands. 
This issue does not affect AMIs which already have the aforementioned packages installed.

### Affected ParallelCluster versions

This issue affects all versions of ParallelCluster up to v3.0.2 and v2.11.3 when the selected OS is CentOS 7 or Ubuntu 18.

### Error details

When building AMIs via the `pcluster build-image` or `pcluster createami` commands the process fails with the following error message, that can be found in the build log:

```bash
curl --retry 3 -L -o /tmp/aws-cfn-bootstrap-latest.tar.gz https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/aws-cfn-bootstrap-latest.tar.gz
pip install /tmp/aws-cfn-bootstrap-latest.tar.gz

File "/tmp/pip-build-im3UcQ/pystache/setup.py", line 183
command = f"pandoc -f markdown-smart --write=rst --output={rst_temp_path} {md_path}"
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

#### Note
* for ParallelCluster 3.x the build log events can be retrieved using the command `pcluster get-image-log-events`
* for ParallelCluster 2.x the build log file path (packer log) is printed by the `pcluster createami` command  

### The workaround
#### v3.0.2
For v3.0.2 the workaround is to patch the ParallelCluster ImageBuilder Component using the provided script
1. create a script named `patch_pcluster.sh` with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
PCLUSTER_MAIN_COMPONENT_FILE="$(find "$(dirname $(which pcluster))/../" -name "parallelcluster.yaml")"
echo "Found PCluster main component file at (${PCLUSTER_MAIN_COMPONENT_FILE})."
echo "Backing up original file to ${PCLUSTER_MAIN_COMPONENT_FILE}.BAK"
cp "${PCLUSTER_MAIN_COMPONENT_FILE}" "${PCLUSTER_MAIN_COMPONENT_FILE}.BAK"
echo "Patching it..."
sed -i 's/"pip2"/"pip3"/g' "${PCLUSTER_MAIN_COMPONENT_FILE}"
sed -i 's/"pip"/"pip3"/g' "${PCLUSTER_MAIN_COMPONENT_FILE}"
sed -i 's/aws-cfn-bootstrap-latest.tar.gz/aws-cfn-bootstrap-py3-latest.tar.gz/g' "${PCLUSTER_MAIN_COMPONENT_FILE}"
echo "Patch done. You can now start build AMI process with 'pcluster build-image' command"
```

2. make the script executable and execute it
```bash
chmod +x patch_pcluster.sh
./patch_pcluster.sh
``` 

You can now use the `pcluster build-image` command to create a custom AMI.
For example, create the following build configuration file `build.yaml`:
```yaml
Region: eu-south-1
Build:
  ParentImage: ${BASE_AMI_ID}
  InstanceType: c5.12xlarge
```
And run the following command to create the image:
```bash
pcluster build-image --image-id fixed-centos7 --image-configuration build.yaml --region ${AWS_REGION}
```

#### v2.11.3
For v2.11.3 the workaround is to use the archive of a patched cookbook that can be found [here](https://us-east-1-aws-parallelcluster.s3.amazonaws.com/patches/2.11.3/aws-parallelcluster-cookbook-2.11.3.tgz). This cookbook contains the contents of the release-2.11 branch up plus [the fix commit](https://github.com/aws/aws-parallelcluster-cookbook/commit/dac8eb29578aaf86f06454a67846af9cff66ae75).
It can be used as the value passed to the `-cc` argument of the `pcluster createami` command:

```bash
pcluster createami -ai ${BASE_AMI_ID} -os ${BASE_AMI_OS} \
  -cc https://us-east-1-aws-parallelcluster.s3.amazonaws.com/patches/2.11.3/aws-parallelcluster-cookbook-2.11.3.tgz
```
