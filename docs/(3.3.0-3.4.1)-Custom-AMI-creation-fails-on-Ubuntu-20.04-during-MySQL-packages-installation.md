## The issue

The process of creating a custom AMI, by using the the `pcluster build-image` command, fails in ParallelCluster 3.3.0 - 3.4.1, when using an Ubuntu 20.04 x86_64 as `ParentImage` in the image build configuration file.

The `pcluster build-image` command will fail after about 1 hour (see `BUILD_FAILED` as `imageBuildStatus`).
```
$ pcluster build-image -c image-config.yaml -i ubuntu20

$ pcluster describe-image -i ubuntu20
{
  ...
  "imageId": "ubuntu20",
  "imagebuilderImageStatus": "FAILED",
  "imagebuilderImageStatusReason": "SSM execution 'e4c5e892-35e3-43bb-be52-d367e708a806' failed for image arn: 'arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-east-1:xxx:image/parallelclusterimage-ubuntu20/3.1.4/1' with status = 'Failed' in state = 'BUILDING' and failure message = 'Document arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-east-1:xxx:component/parallelclusterimage-9d99aa00-9e27-11ed-ad2d-0e24e64524eb/3.1.4/1 failed!'",
  "imageBuildStatus": "BUILD_FAILED",
  "cloudformationStackStatus": "CREATE_FAILED",
  ...
```
The reason is that the installation of the MySQL packages, during the execution of the `install_mysql_client` recipe, part of the official ParallelCluster cookbook, is failing with the following error message:
```
#20 598.8 The following packages will be upgraded:
#20 598.8   mysql-common
#20 598.8 The following packages will be DOWNGRADED:
#20 598.8   libmysqlclient-dev libmysqlclient21
#20 598.8 1 upgraded, 1 newly installed, 2 downgraded, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
#20 598.8 STDERR: WARNING: apt does not have a stable CLI interface. Use with caution in scripts.
#20 598.8 
#20 598.8 E: Packages were downgraded and -y was used without --allow-downgrades.
```
The custom AMI creation process started to fail on January 25th, because an updated version of MySQL packages ([8.0.32](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)) has been released in the Ubuntu OS repository. This package is installed in the system by the initial phases of the build AMI process and then the `install_mysql_client` code tries to install the old 8.0.31 version on top of the updated version, causing the installation steps to fail.

## Affected versions

* ParallelCluster versions released after the introduction of the Slurm Accounting feature are affected: 3.3.0 - 3.4.1.
* Affected OS is Ubuntu 20.04 x86_64.

## Mitigation

We prepared a [patched cookbook](https://us-east-1-aws-parallelcluster.s3.amazonaws.com/patches/3.4.1/aws-parallelcluster-cookbook-3.4.1.tgz) and uploaded it in a public bucket. To fix the build image process you need to use it in the image configuration file, in the `DevSettings / Cookbook` parameter. 

Note that the patched cookbook is compatible only with the latest version of ParallelCluster: 3.4.1. If you’re using an old version we recommend you to move to the latest one.

Create a build image configuration file as the following and use it as input for the `build-image` command.
```
Image:
  Name: <your_image_name>
Build:
  InstanceType: <your_instance_type> 
  ParentImage: <your_parent_image_id>
DevSettings:
  Cookbook:
    ChefCookbook: https://us-east-1-aws-parallelcluster.s3.amazonaws.com/patches/3.4.1/aws-parallelcluster-cookbook-3.4.1.tgz
```
The `pcluster build-image` command will work as expected and after about 1 hour the created image will be available as expected.
```
$ pcluster build-image -c patched-image-config.yaml -i ubuntu20-working

# After about 1h the image will be created and can be described successfully
$ pcluster describe-image -i ubuntu20-working
{
  ...
  "imageId": "ubuntu20-working",
  "imageBuildStatus": "BUILD_COMPLETE",
  ...
```
## Error details

When using the default cookbook, it is possible to see the details of the failure by looking at the logs:
```
$ pcluster list-image-log-streams -i ubuntu20 -r us-east-1
{
  "logStreams": [
    {
      "logStreamArn": "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:xxx:log-group:/aws/imagebuilder/ParallelClusterImage-ubuntu20:log-stream:3.1.4/1",
      "logStreamName": "3.4.1/1",
      ...
    }
  ]
}

$ pcluster get-image-log-events -i ubuntu20 --log-stream-name 3.4.1/1 --limit 15
{
  ...
  "events": [
    {
      "message": "Stdout: The following packages will be DOWNGRADED:",
      "timestamp": "2023-01-27T11:20:16.887Z"
    },
    {
      "message": "Stdout:   libmysqlclient-dev libmysqlclient21",
      "timestamp": "2023-01-27T11:20:16.887Z"
    },
    {
      "message": "Stdout: 1 upgraded, 1 newly installed, 2 downgraded, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.",
      "timestamp": "2023-01-27T11:20:16.887Z"
    },
    ...
    {
      "message": "Stdout: E: Packages were downgraded and -y was used without --allow-downgrades.",
      "timestamp": "2023-01-27T11:20:16.887Z"
    },
    ...
    {
      "message": "TOE has completed execution with failure - Execution failed!",
      "timestamp": "2023-01-27T11:20:17.984Z"
    }
  ]
}
```


The `install_mysql_client` recipe tries to install the 8.0.31 version on top of an updated version, without using the `--allow-downgrades` flag. In this case apt throws an exit code `100`. 
In the recipe we are calling `apt install -y` from a `bash` block, with `set -e` configured, which causes the whole block to fail if any command returns a non-zero status code.

This wasn’t an issue in past because the version installed in the system, coming from OS repository, was aligned with the version installed by the `install_mysql_client` recipe. On Jan, 25 a new version of MySQL was released in the OS repositories (8.0.32) causing the build image process to fail.
