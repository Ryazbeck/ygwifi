## The issue
The cluster may hit issues during scale-up operations with new nodes joining after a cluster update where shared EBS volumes have been removed from the SharedStorages section of the configuration.

In particular, the error occurs if the removed EBS had a MountDir path that's a sub-path of other volumes shared in the cluster. For example, removing a custom shared storage with a mount directory as `/shared`, `/slurm`, `/parallelcuster/shared` or `/intel` would corrupt the ParallelCluster NFS export paths from the head node, causing the mount operations on the compute nodes to fail.

More in general, the issue happens whenever you remove a shared EBS with mount path `/path_1` and another system or custom EBS volume has an export path as `/path_2/path_1`.

This is caused by an issue in our code to unmount shared EBS volumes, which deletes lines from `/etc/exports` that match the regular expression of the `/<MountDir> ` without checking if it starts with `^/<MountDir> `. For example, if you have multiple SharedEBS volumes with MountDir that are contains the path name of each other: `path_1` and `path_2/path_1`. Both paths ( `/path_1` and `/path_2/path_1)`are written in `/etc/exports`. If you update the cluster to remove shared EBS with `path_1`, the regular expression with match lines that have `/path_1` and also unintentionally removed `/path_2/path_1`, further cluster operations like launching nodes or submitting jobs may fail due to required softwares or paths no longer exported over NFS. 

## Affected versions (OSes, schedulers)

* ParallelCluster 3.3.0 -3.5.0

## Mitigation

After updating the cluster to remove shared EBS volumes, check `/etc/exports` to see if there’s missing lines in `/etc/exports`, make sure your `/etc/exports`  file contains the following lines plus any additional export based on the EBS shared storage set into cluster configuration:

```
/home 192.168.0.0/17(rw,sync,no_root_squash) 192.168.128.0/17(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
/opt/parallelcluster/shared 192.168.0.0/17(rw,sync,no_root_squash) 192.168.128.0/17(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
/opt/intel 192.168.0.0/17(rw,sync,no_root_squash) 192.168.128.0/17(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
/opt/slurm 192.168.0.0/17(rw,sync,no_root_squash) 192.168.128.0/17(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
```

* If they are missing, stop the cluster compute fleet with:

```
pcluster update-compute-fleet —-cluster-name<cluster-name> —-status STOP_REQUESTED
```

* If any of these lines are missing or any shared EBS `MountDir` is missing , add them back to `/etc/exports`, then run the following command the re-export the NFS shareds.

```
sudo exportfs -ra
```

* Start the cluster compute fleet with:

```
pcluster update-compute-fleet —-cluster-name <cluster-name> —-status START_REQUESTED
```
