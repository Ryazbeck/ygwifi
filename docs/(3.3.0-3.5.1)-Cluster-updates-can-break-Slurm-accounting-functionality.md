## The issue

In ParallelCluster versions `3.3.0` up to `3.5.1`, if you enabled the [Slurm accounting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/Scheduling-v3.html#Scheduling-v3-SlurmSettings-Database) feature, a  `cluster-update` operation involving any change to settings under the [`Scheduling`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/Scheduling-v3.html) section, will break Slurm accounting configuration on the system.

Slurm accounting functionality will continue running unless a restart of the `slurmdbd` or, more in general, a reboot of the head node is executed.

## Affected versions

* ParallelCluster 3.3.0 - 3.5.1, if [Slurm Accounting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/Scheduling-v3.html#Scheduling-v3-SlurmSettings-Database) functionality is enabled.
* All OSes are affected.

## How to detect if you are affected

Any Slurm command trying to query the Slurm database will fail with a `Connection refused` error:

```
$ sacct 
sacct: error: slurm_persist_conn_open_without_init: failed to open persistent connection to host:ip-10-0-0-213:6819: Connection refused
```

And the `slurmdbd` service will be in `failed` state.

You can double check that, as a consequence of a `update-cluster`, you have a default `dummy` value for the `StoragePass` parameter in the `slurm_parallelcluster_slurmdbd.conf` file:

```
$ sudo grep StoragePass /opt/slurm/etc/slurm_parallelcluster_slurmdbd.conf
StoragePass=dummy
```

## Mitigation

You can restore the original password by running the following command from the head node:

```
sudo /opt/parallelcluster/scripts/slurm/update_slurm_database_password.sh
```

Check `slurmdbd` service status in the head node

```
sudo systemctl status slurmdbd
```

Only if the the service is in a `failed` state, restart it

```
sudo systemctl restart slurmdbd
```

Verify that the Slurm accounting functionality is back

```
$ sacct
JobID        JobName    Partition  Account    AllocCPUS  State      ExitCode 
------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- -------- 
...
```
