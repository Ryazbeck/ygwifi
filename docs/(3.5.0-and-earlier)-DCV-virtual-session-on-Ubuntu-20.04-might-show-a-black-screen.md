## The issue

ParallelCluster 3.5.0 and earlier versions are impacted by a known issue with DCV `2022.1-13300` and earlier, which intermittently causes a blank (black) screen in virtual sessions on Ubuntu `20.04`. The issue triggers at the start of a virtual session due to a race condition, therefore it may happen for some virtual sessions and not others.

## Affected versions

* ParallelCluster version `3.5.0` and earlier are impacted.

## Mitigation

Upgrading DCV on the head node solves the problem. Below is a guide for upgrading DCV for your reference:

1. SSH into the head node of the affected cluster:
```
pcluster ssh --cluster-name <cluster-name>
```
2. List active DCV sessions
```
dcv list-sessions
```
3. Close running DCV sessions (You may need to run the command multiple times if there are multiple sessions)
```
dcv close-session <session-id>
```
4. Upgrade DCV (You can simply run the following script on Head Node, or learn more at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/adminguide/setting-up-installing-linux-server.html#linux-server-install). 

Paste the following script into a file `install.sh` and make it executable. Uncomment the line to install the `nice-dcv-gl` if the instance has GPU. Run the script. 
```.sh
#!/bin/bash -ex

WORK_DIR=`mktemp -d`
DCV_VERSION=2022.2-14521
DCV_FILE=nice-dcv-${DCV_VERSION}-ubuntu2004-x86_64
